Running this file should only require the installation of Python and an IDE on your computer.  There is not an interactive menu: testing requires modification or addition of test cases inside EC.py.

To make this an offical assignment, the addition of interactive elements might be a worthwhile part of the task.  Besides an interactive menu in command prompt, it is more within the scope of this class to make something than can be used through a website.  Perhaps the requirment of linking an API to the written code.  Something like this should still be able to be turned in for partial credit, at least 50%.
